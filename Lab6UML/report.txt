 The Umple code has a lot more going on than the simple code I wrote. 
 It is very cool in that it also throws in checks for exceptions and additional methods to get and set each variable.
 It would be especially useful when making a class structure with lots of variables. 
 This way, I wouldn't have to make all the methods to get and set each variable by hand, which would save a lot of time.
 However, I would not want to always use UMPLE, because it is always easier to read and understand your own code.
 For the associations, it is interesting that it not only gives each Customer an Account, but also each Account a Customer. 
 It also gives each Customer a List of Orders, which would be a good way of storing them.
 However, that is important to keep in mind, in case I had wanted to use something else to store the Orders, such as an array.
 It is really cool that it was able to generate all that java code just from 25 lines of UML code.
 I also like that it makes a toString method for you. 
 It also has multiple constructors for Customer and Account, which would be nice for the client so they can have some options.
